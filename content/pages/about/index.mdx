Hi there, my name is **Sid Mansukhani**. I am a husband, father and developer based in Melbourne, Australia. I am currently working at Isobar Australia as a Senior Developer. My main area of expertise is back-end web development using C#/ASP.NET. I am also currently doing a lot of work with Microsoft Azure. With almost 20 years of web development experience, I am passionate about software development and love to experiment with new technologies. I speak 5 human languages and several computer languages. In my free time, I love spending time with my family, watching movies, trying out new restaurants and travelling.
