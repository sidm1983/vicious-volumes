title: A Developer-Friendly Way to Analyse Log Files
date: 2020-02-23

Let's say you've been asked to analyse web server log files, like IIS logs for example. How would you go about doing this? There are many ways of course. You could import the log file into a database and run queries against it. You could also download software like Microsoft's Log Parser and run SQL-like queries to make sense of your logs. What about using Microsoft Excel? Sure, that works too.

Today, we are not going to use any of the above methods. Instead, we are going to attempt to extract meaningful data from IIS log files using a developer-friendly approach. (Psst...this approach should work for extracting data out of any type of text file, and not just IIS log files.)

Now, the approach in question uses a Linux command to help with extracting data, so developers who work in the Linux world are probably very familiar with what I am about to demonstrate. However, if you've been living in the world of Windows or you are new to Linux, then keep reading.

### To WSL or not to WSL...

That is definitely a question, and the answer depends on whether you are reading this post on Linux or Windows. Linux users can skip this section and move on to the next. If you are on Windows (hopefully a 64-bit installation of Windows 10 version 1607 or higher ü§ûüèª), you will need to install the **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**. Follow <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10" target="_blank">these instructions</a> to enable WSL and install your preferred Linux distribution on Windows. If you are unsure which one to choose, just install Ubuntu 18.04 LTS from the Microsoft Store. That's the one I am using. So go ahead, install that and come back when you're ready. Don't worry, I'll wait for you...I promise!
